# HTML AND CSS
In this repository, I practice many things about HTML and CSS because I've programmed in React and Angular, but I've never learned deeply about the basics of web programming. 
So, I decided to practice with this mini project.

Many topics in this repository:
1. Meta 
2. Link
3. Style
4. Header
5. h1 -> h6
6. nav
7. main
8. p
8. ul / ol
9. img
10. aside
11. section
12. article
14. footer
